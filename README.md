AndroidRepo-Bot is a bot made for [@AndroidRepo](https://t.me/AndroidRepo) (Telegram channel), it was initially thought only to update the Magisk modules in the channel, but we will improve it over time.

Developed in Python using the MTProto library [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram).
